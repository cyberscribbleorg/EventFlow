# EventFlow
Empower Your Git Project with Data-Driven Insights

## Setup (WIP)
1. Install Docker and Docker Compose for your environment.
2. Copy `env.copy` to `.env` and adjust parameters if required.
3. Configure `injector/config.json` parameters for harvest.
4. Run `docker-compose up` to spin up all instances.
5. Things should work fine.

## Improvements Planned
- Injector service multi-threading capability.
- Automation of dashboards/datasets/graphs generation.
